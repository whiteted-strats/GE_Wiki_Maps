# Currently we have 2 similar functions:
#   - drawSets - shows all sets, with lines between sets highlighted using 
#   - drawNavGraph - shows all sets, labelling pads (including those that coincide) and sets

# Note that drawSets assumes that boundaries between sets only consist of individual links of 1 pad to 1 pad,
#   when there are actually at most 2 effectively (because of guard routing) and we should find these

# TODO improve
